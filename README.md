# Lists_and_Dictionaries_in_Python
My python journey ! I had a lot of fun learning about lists and dictionaries. In this Repository, engage in a quiz game, generate student lists, play a higher lower game, and simulate a coffee machine. 
# Student Data Generation and Manipulation

# Description:
A Python script that allows users to input information about students (first name, last name, age, and degree program) and stores the data in a list of dictionaries. The code then displays the entered data in reverse order.

# Quiz Game

# Description: 
A simple Python quiz game using previously defined quiz data. Users are prompted with questions, provide answers, and receive immediate feedback and score. The score is kept track of and displayed after each question.

# Higher or Lower Game

# Description: 
An interactive Python game comparing follower counts. It displays higher lower logos, names, and descriptions, and users have to guess who has a higher follower count. The game provides feedback and reveals the correct answer along with follower counts.

# Coffee Machine Simulator 

# Description: 
An ongoing Python script simulating a coffee machine. Users can place orders for espresso, cappuccino, or latte, and the program checks if there are enough resources and money to fulfill the order. The script calculates the cost, processes money, and adjusts resource levels. Note: The script is currently incomplete and may need further development.
